# Error Handling in Swift

Swift provides a robust error-handling mechanism using throw, throws, and do-catch statements. This README covers how to properly handle errors in Swift applications within the MVVM architecture.

### 1. Error Handling in MVVM

In MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture, error handling should be structured in a way that keeps the UI logic separate from the business logic. The ViewModel is responsible for processing data and handling errors before updating the View.

### 2. Key Principles of Error Handling in MVVM

Error Encapsulation: Define error types at the Model level or use a dedicated Error Manager.

Propagating Errors: The ViewModel should handle errors and provide a user-friendly message to the View.

State Management: Use observable properties (e.g., Combine, RxSwift, or simple closures) to update the UI when an error occurs.

Logging & Debugging: Ensure proper logging for easier debugging.

### 3. Common Approaches in MVVM Error Handling

Using Result Type

Instead of throwing errors directly, you can use the Result type in your ViewModel to return either a success or failure state.

Error Messaging

Use an errorMessage property in the ViewModel to provide human-readable error messages to the View.

Centralized Error Handling

Create an Error Manager that handles different error types and provides consistent error handling across the app.

### 4. API Usage Example

This project utilizes the following API for testing error handling and data fetching:

API Endpoint: JSONPlaceholder Users API

This API provides dummy user data that can be used to simulate network requests, test error handling, and manage response states within the MVVM architecture.

### 5. Summary

Implement error handling within ViewModel, ensuring errors are processed before updating the UI.

Use Result types or observables to manage error states.

Keep business logic separate from UI logic for better maintainability.

Provide user-friendly error messages and logging for debugging.

Utilize external APIs like JSONPlaceholder to test network error handling.

This ensures a clean and maintainable error-handling mechanism in MVVM-based Swift applications!
